Where Homebrew Packages Are Installed on Mac OS: the Homebrew Installation Path
By default, Homebrew will install all packages into the following directory in all versions of Mac OS:

/usr/local/Cellar/

Additionally, Homebrew places symlinks into the following directory path:

/usr/local/opt/

The symbolic links of binaries found in /usr/local/opt/ all point to their respective package in /usr/local/Cellar/ as can be confirmed with ls and the -l flag:

ls -l /usr/local/opt/
